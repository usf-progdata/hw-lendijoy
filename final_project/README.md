# Final Project Repository

## Description

This repository is a space for me to work on my Final Project for the Programming with Data class taught by Dr. Brenton Wiernik during the spring semester of 2021 at the University of South Florida. For the project, I will choose a dataset, import it, wrangle it, and produce analytic results and visualizations to address a research question of interest. 

## Project Overview  
### An Exploratory Factor Analysis of Volunteer Functions and Motivations     

For this project, I will be reanalyzing my thesis data using an exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The objective of my thesis was to create a comprehensive model of volunteering motivation by combining the Functional Approach to Volunteering with the Theory of Planned Behavior.

#### The Functional Approach to Volunteering (FAV)

The FAV suggests that individuals evaluate the purpose or benefits of volunteering (functions). Individuals then engage in volunteering if the perceived functions are positively evaluated. Individuals are then motivated to continue volunteering only when volunteering fulfills its perceived or intended purpose and therefore the individualâ€™s needs.

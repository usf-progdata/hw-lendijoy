# Final Project Repository

## Description

This repository is a space for me to work on my Final Project for the Programming with Data class taught by Dr. Brenton Wiernik during the spring semester of 2021 at the University of South Florida. For the project, I will choose a dataset, import it, wrangle it, and produce analytic results and visualizations to address a research question of interest.

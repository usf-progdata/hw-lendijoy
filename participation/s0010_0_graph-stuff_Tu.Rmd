## Basic elements of ggplot

1. Data
2. Aesthetics (mapping)
3. Geoms
4. Facets
5. Stats

## Changing the `stat`

In the process of connecting data -> mapping, there is some **statistical computation**. 
In many cases, this computation is `identity()`. For example, with `geom_point()`, it plots the points directly based on `x` and `y` values.
Other times, there is more of a computation.

  - `stat_count()`
  - `stat_bin()`
  - `stat_density()`
  
`geom_*()` functions usually come with a reasonable default `stat_*()` and subsequent mapping.
For example, `geom_histogram()` does `stat_bin()` to bin the continuous values, then `aes()` maps `y` to the count in each bin.

But sometimes you might want to change this mapping after the stat.
Do that with `after_stat()` inside `aes()`.
  
```{r}
bw <- .3

h1 <- ggplot(mpg) +
  aes(x = displ) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = bw, fill = "skyblue")

## histogram with density
h2 <- ggplot(mpg) +
  aes(x = displ) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)),
                 binwidth = bw, fill = "skyblue")

## histogram with proportion
h3 <- ggplot(mpg) +
  aes(x = displ) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count / sum(count))),
                 binwidth = bw, fill = "skyblue")

h1 + h2 + h3

## histogram with density curve
ggplot(mpg) +
  aes(displ) +
	geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count)), 
	               binwidth = bw, fill = "skyblue") +
	geom_density(aes(y = after_stat(count) * bw)) +
	theme_minimal()
```


## Customizing plots!

You can customize all sorts of stuff in your ggplot plots!

1. Scales
  - x and y
  - Colors
  - Shapes
  - Line types
  - Alpha
2. Guides
  - Legend (legend, bins, colorbar, colorsteps)
  - Axis
  - None
3. Text
  - Axis labels
  - Geom labels
  - Annotations
  - Titles and captions
4. Themes (design features)
  - Background
  - Grid lines
  - Text styling
  - Alignment

### Scales

A ggplot is constructed with a flow like this:

> data -> stat -> scale -> mapping -> render

The "scale" step concerns how the computed data/stat corresponds to numbers/values on the plot (e.g., "20 mpg" corresponds to a point "3 units up on the y axis"; "4 cylinder" corresponds to "blue").

You control how values are scaled using the `scale_*()` functions.
Almost every aesthetic you can map to data (e.g., `x`, `y`, `color`, `fill`, `alpha`, `linetype`, `shape`, `size`, `radius`) has corresponding scale functions.

These functions all have the following form:

> `scale_[aesthetic]_[type]`

The `scale_*()` functions include many arguments to control various features of the scale, depending on the aesthetic.

#### Position scales

The scales for `x` and `y` control positioning, limits, breaks, labels, titles, etc. of the axes. 

  - `scale_x_continuous()`
  - `scale_x_discrete()`
  - `scale_x_binned()`

##### Arguments

1. `name()`
  - The name of the scale. Used for the axis/legend title.
  - Give multiple scales the same name to combine them.
2. `breaks`
  - Where to break the scale (e.g., where to bin or where to place labeled tick marks)
  - To override the default computed breaks, pass a vector of values
  - (There are more advanced options as well)
3. `labels`
  - Override the existing axis labels
  - Usually given as a function that transforms the text
  - e.g.,
    - Numbers and Dates
      - scales::label_percent
      - scales::label_dollar
      - scales::label_date
      - scales::label_comma
      - scales::label_pvalue
    - Text
      - stringr::str_to_upper
      - stringr::str_to_sentence
      - scales::label_parse / scales::label_math
4. `limits`
  - The minimum and maximum values for the scale
5. `oob`
  - What to do with values outside the `limits`
  - Defaults
    - Continuous: `scales::oob_censor`
    - Binned: `scales::oob_squish`
  - `scales::oob_keep`: Like zooming, don't remove or change values.
6. `trans`
  - A transformation function to apply to each value of the scales
  - Must be a quoted function name
  - e.g., "sqrt" or "rev" or "log10"
  - `scale_x_sqrt()`, `scale_x_reverse()`, and `scale_x_log10` are shortcuts
7. `position`
  - "top", "bottom", "left", or "right"
  - Can also be set in `guide_axis()`
8. `guide`
  - A function controlling formatting of the guide
  - I usually set in `guides()` instead
